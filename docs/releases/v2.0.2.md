# GitBook Worker v2.0.2 Release Notes (Draft)

**Release date (planned)**: December 31, 2025  
**Focus**: doc_type summary alignment, translator-note consistency, manifest metadata bumps

## What changed
- doc_type summary alignment: template entries are now surfaced in SUMMARY generation (show_in_summary removed to avoid accidental hiding; both de/en manifests bumped to 0.1.1).
- Translator notes: added explicit H1 headings and clarified source-edition wording (de/en) so PDF outputs render the section title and correct provenance.
- Manifest metadata: publish.yml versions bumped (0.1.1) to reflect doc_type summary config adjustments.
- Bug capture: logged backlog item for README generator writing README.md in code area during docker-based orchestrator runs (no fix yet).

## Upgrade notes
- No schema changes to publish.yml; only version fields bumped. Pipelines continue to parse existing manifests.
- After pulling: regenerate SUMMARY for each locale to pick up template entries, e.g. `gitbook_style summary --root de --document-manifest de/publish.yml --summary-appendices-last --validate-doc-types` (same for en).
- Re-run orchestrator once fonts are synced: `python -m gitbook_worker.tools.workflow_orchestrator run --root . --content-config content.yaml --lang de --profile default`.

## Known issues / open items
- Test suite: `pytest gitbook_worker/tests -m "not slow" -q` currently fails (root cause not yet triaged in this draft).
- README generator bug: still open; see backlog entry `gitbook_worker/docs/backlog/to_fix/2025-12-31-readme-generator-docker-run.md`.
- Emoji test assets: untracked `de/publish/emoji-test-page-39.png` … `-43.png` remain uncommitted; decide whether to track or ignore before release.

## Next steps
- Triage and fix the failing pytest subset, then rerun full suite.
- Decide on handling for README generator scope; implement guard or path filter before GA.
- Clean working tree (emoji test artifacts) or add to .gitignore prior to tagging.
