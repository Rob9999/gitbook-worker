# Archive Overview

This directory hosts historical documentation and artifacts that previously lived
under `.github/gitbook_worker/`. Each subfolder preserves its original layout so
old references continue to work:

- `legacy-package/` – snapshot of the former `.github/gitbook_worker` docs, including
  architecture notes, migration plans, and Docker references.

New documentation should stay in `docs/` (user-facing) or `gitbook_worker/docs/`
(engineering). The archive exists purely for reference and is excluded from
active maintenance.
