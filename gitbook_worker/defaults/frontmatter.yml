# Default front matter configuration
#
# This file controls whether YAML front matter is automatically injected into
# markdown files during the workflow orchestration.
#
# version: Schema version for future extensions.
# enabled: Global switch to enable/disable front matter injection (default: false).
# patterns: Smart pattern matching to control which files get front matter.
#   - include: List of glob patterns for files to include (relative to repo root).
#   - exclude: List of glob patterns for files to exclude (takes precedence over include).
# template: The YAML front matter template to inject into matching files.
#   - Fields are key-value pairs where values can be strings, lists, booleans, or null.
#   - Special placeholders:
#     * {{date}}: Replaced with git last commit date of the file (YYYY-MM-DD format).
#
# Usage:
#   - By default (enabled: false), no front matter is injected.
#   - When enabled: true, files matching include patterns (and not matching exclude)
#     will receive the template front matter if not already present.
#   - Missing fields in existing front matter are added; existing fields remain untouched.
#   - This configuration can be overridden per-publication in publish.yml.
