# README Auto-Generation Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Controls automatic creation of README.md files in directories without any
# readme variant (case-insensitive check).
#
# This configuration uses the same smart matching pattern system as other
# gitbook_worker configurations (frontmatter, fonts, etc.).
#
# Priority: publish.yml > local readme.yml > this default
# =============================================================================

# Pattern matching for directories
patterns:
  # Directories to include (glob patterns, relative to repo root)
  # Empty list means "include all"
  include: []

  # Directories to exclude (glob patterns, relative to repo root)
  # These patterns are checked first - if a path matches exclude, it's skipped
  exclude:
    # Version control
    - ".git"
    - ".git/**"

    # Build artifacts and dependencies
    - "node_modules"
    - "node_modules/**"
    - "__pycache__"
    - "__pycache__/**"
    - ".venv"

# Template for generated README.md files
template:
  # Use directory name as header
  use_directory_name: true

  # Header level (1-6)
  header_level: 1

  # Additional content to append after header (optional)
  # Use {{directory_name}} as placeholder
  footer: ""

  # Example with footer:
  # footer: |
  #
  #   This directory contains {{directory_name}} resources.

# Case-insensitive variants to check before creating README
# If ANY of these exists (case-insensitive), skip directory
# Note: The code also performs a case-insensitive directory scan as fallback,
# so these are the most common variants that are checked first for performance.
readme_variants:
  # Standard variants (most common)
  - "README.md"
  - "readme.md"
  - "Readme.md"
  - "ReadMe.md"

  # Uppercase extension variants
  - "README.MD"
  - "readme.MD"
  - "Readme.MD"
  - "ReadMe.MD"

  # Common typos and alternative capitalizations
  - "READ_ME.md"
  - "read_me.md"
