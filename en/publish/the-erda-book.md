# Chapter 1 – Observable patterns

In software development, we repeatedly encounter similar problems for which proven solutions have been established over time. These recurring structures are referred to as design patterns.

## Historical development

The systematic documentation of design patterns began in the 1990s. Inspired by architecture, where Christopher Alexander described patterns for building construction, software developers transferred this idea to programming.

### Early pioneers

The so-called "Gang of Four" (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides) published the seminal work "Design Patterns" in 1994, which categorised and described 23 patterns.

### Modern developments

Today, hundreds of documented patterns exist for a wide variety of application areas – from microservices and reactive programming to cloud architectures.

## Categories of patterns

Design patterns can be divided into three main categories:

### Creational patterns

These patterns deal with object creation and attempt to make object instantiation more flexible:

- **Singleton**: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists
- **Factory**: Encapsulates object creation
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation

### Structural patterns

Structural patterns describe how classes and objects can be composed into larger structures:

- **Adapter**: Enables collaboration between incompatible interfaces
- **Composite**: Forms tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
- **Decorator**: Dynamically extends objects with additional functionality

### Behavioural patterns

These patterns address the interaction between objects and the distribution of responsibilities:

- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that changes are automatically propagated
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects

## Advantages of using patterns

Using established design patterns offers several advantages:

1. **Common language**: Teams can communicate complex concepts precisely
2. **Proven solutions**: Patterns have been proven in practice and are well documented
3. **Maintainability**: Code becomes more structured and easier to understand
4. **Flexibility**: Changes can often be implemented with less effort

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their advantages, design patterns are not a panacea:

- **Over-engineering**: Not every problem requires a complex pattern
- **Learning curve**: Understanding and correct application require experience
- **Context dependency**: A pattern must fit the specific situation

## Practical application

When deciding on a design pattern, the following questions should be asked:

1. What problem needs to be solved?
2. Is there an established pattern for this problem?
3. Does the complexity of the pattern justify the expected benefit?
4. Does the pattern fit with the existing architecture?

## Summary

Design patterns are a valuable tool in software development. They provide tested solutions for recurring problems and promote a common technical language. However, their sensible application requires experience and judgement to avoid falling into the trap of over-engineering.

# Chapter 2 – Comparative tables

Tables are an indispensable tool for the structured presentation of information. They enable direct comparison of different options, technologies, or concepts at a glance.

## Fundamentals of tabular presentation

A well-designed table follows clear principles:

### Structure and organisation

| Element | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Header row | Contains column labels | Orientation for the reader |
| Data rows | Contain the actual information | Comparable presentation |
| Summary | Optional: sums or averages | Aggregated insights |

### Design principles

Effective tables are characterised by the following features:

1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous column and row labels
2. **Consistency**: Uniform formatting within columns
3. **Readability**: Appropriate line spacing and font sizes
4. **Relevance**: Display only necessary information

## Comparison of programming paradigms

A practical example of using comparison tables is the juxtaposition of different programming paradigms:

| Paradigm | Main features | Typical languages | Application areas |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Imperative | Step-by-step instructions | C, Pascal, BASIC | Systems programming |
| Object-oriented | Classes and objects | Java, C++, Python | Enterprise applications |
| Functional | Immutable data | Haskell, Erlang, F\# | Data processing |
| Declarative | What instead of How | SQL, HTML, Prolog | Database queries |

### Detailed consideration

Each paradigm has its strengths and weaknesses:

**Imperative programming**
- Direct control over flow
- Efficient at hardware level
- Can become confusing with complexity

**Object-oriented programming**
- Modular structure
- Reusability through inheritance
- Can lead to overhead

**Functional programming**
- No side effects
- Easy to test
- Learning curve for switchers

## Technology comparisons

Comparison tables are particularly suitable for technology decisions:

### Web framework comparison

| Framework | Language | Performance | Learning curve | Community |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Django | Python | Medium | Medium | Very large |
| Flask | Python | High | Low | Large |
| Spring | Java | Medium | High | Very large |
| Express | JavaScript | High | Low | Very large |
| Rails | Ruby | Medium | Medium | Large |

### Evaluation criteria

Various factors play a role in technology selection:

1. **Performance**: Throughput and response times
2. **Developer productivity**: Speed of development
3. **Maintainability**: Long-term maintenance effort
4. **Scalability**: Growth potential
5. **Ecosystem**: Available libraries and tools

## Database comparison

Another common application area is database comparisons:

| Type | Example | Consistency | Scaling | Use case |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Relational | PostgreSQL | ACID | Vertical | Transactions |
| Document | MongoDB | Eventual | Horizontal | Flexible schemas |
| Key-value | Redis | Eventual | Horizontal | Caching |
| Graph | Neo4j | ACID | Vertical | Relationships |
| Column | Cassandra | Eventual | Horizontal | Time series |

### CAP theorem

For distributed databases, the CAP theorem is relevant:

- **C**onsistency: All nodes see the same data
- **A**vailability: System always responds
- **P**artition tolerance: System functions despite network failures

According to the CAP theorem, only two of the three properties can be guaranteed simultaneously.

## Best practices for tables

When creating comparison tables, the following points should be considered:

### Content aspects

- Select relevant comparison criteria
- Use objective and verifiable data
- Cite sources where necessary
- Ensure data is current

### Visual design

- Zebra pattern for better readability in long tables
- Highlighting of important rows or columns
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Sorting and filtering options for interactive tables

## Summary

Comparison tables are a powerful tool for the structured presentation of complex information. They enable quick comparisons and informed decisions. The key to success lies in carefully selecting relevant criteria and presenting them clearly and consistently.

# Epilogue

Documentation is a living artefact. As technologies evolve and understanding deepens, good documentation grows and adapts to serve its readers better.

## The documentation journey

Creating effective documentation is an iterative process:

1. **Initial creation**: Capturing knowledge whilst it's fresh
2. **Review and refinement**: Improving clarity and accuracy
3. **User feedback**: Learning from readers' experiences
4. **Continuous improvement**: Evolving with changing needs

## Looking forward

The principles demonstrated in this documentation – clear structure, comprehensive examples, and attention to technical detail – remain relevant regardless of the specific tools or technologies employed.

## Final thoughts

Good documentation respects the reader's time and intelligence. It provides clear paths to understanding whilst remaining accessible to those encountering the material for the first time.

May your own documentation efforts be similarly rewarding, both in their creation and in the value they provide to your readers.

## Technical challenges

### Flag emojis

Country flags are particularly complex:

- **Regional Indicator Symbols**: Two letter characters form a flag
- **ISO 3166-1**: Based on country codes (e.g. DE = 🇩🇪)
- **Font dependency**: Not all systems display all flags
- **Fallback**: Letters are displayed when support is missing

### Symbol emojis

Symbols include:

- **Mathematical symbols**: ➕ ➖ ➗ × ÷
- **Geometric shapes**: ■ ● ▲ ⭐
- **Pictograms**: ♿ ⚠️ ☢️ ☣️

# Image examples – Assets & layout

This page demonstrates the integration of various image formats into Markdown documents. All assets used are located in the `content/.gitbook/assets/` directory and are legally safe.

## Image formats compared

### Raster images (PNG)

Raster images are suitable for:
- Photographs and complex graphics
- Images with many colour gradients
- Screenshots and screen captures

**Disadvantage**: Enlargement can lead to quality loss.

![SAMPLE Logo (PNG)](.gitbook/assets/SAMPLE_Logo_simple.png){fig-alt="SAMPLE Logo"}

### Vector images (SVG)

Vector images offer:
- Arbitrary scalability without quality loss
- Small file sizes for simple graphics
- Sharp display on all screen resolutions

**Ideal for**: Diagrams, icons, technical drawings

![Neutral grid (SVG)](.gitbook/assets/neutral-grid.pdf)

### Diagrams and workflows

Structured representations such as flowcharts particularly benefit from vector graphics:

![Neutral workflow (SVG)](.gitbook/assets/neutral-flow.pdf)

# Image examples – Captions & density

This test page checks the behaviour with multiple images in quick succession. Particularly relevant for:

- **Page breaks**: How does the layout behave with many images?
- **Image captions**: Are captions positioned correctly?
- **Spacing**: Sufficient space between images?
- **Numbering**: Sequential image numbers in lists of figures?

## Gallery (SVG)

Multiple similar images in sequence test the layout:

![Neutral shapes – A](.gitbook/assets/neutral-shapes.pdf)

_Figure 1: First instance of shape representation_

![Neutral shapes – B](.gitbook/assets/neutral-shapes.pdf)

_Figure 2: Second instance to check for repetitions_

## Mixed (SVG + PNG)

Combination of different image formats in one section:

![Neutral grid](.gitbook/assets/neutral-grid.pdf)

_Figure 3: Vector graphic with grid pattern_

![SAMPLE Logo](.gitbook/assets/SAMPLE_Logo_simple.png)

_Figure 4: Raster graphic (PNG format)_

## Technical aspects

### Image captions

Image captions should:

1. Clearly describe the image
2. Establish context to surrounding text
3. Include source references where needed
4. Be consistently numbered

### Layout challenges

When placing multiple images, the following aspects must be considered:

- **Widow/orphan control**: Don't separate captions from images
- **Page breaks**: Don't split large images in the middle
- **Spacing**: Sufficient space between elements
- **Alignment**: Consistent positioning

### Accessibility

For better accessibility:

- Every image gets a meaningful alt text
- Captions supplement visually presented information
- Colour schemes consider colour blindness
- Contrasts are sufficiently high

# 🧪 Emoji in headings – Header samples

This page tests the correct display of emojis in headings at different levels. Particularly relevant is the encoding in PDF bookmarks and the table of contents.

## 🎯 Test scenarios

Emojis in headings place special demands on document processing:

- **PDF bookmarks**: Correct Unicode encoding in PDF table of contents
- **TOC generation**: Table of contents with emoji characters
- **Font fallbacks**: Switching between text and emoji fonts
- **Hierarchy**: Emojis at all heading levels (H1-H6)

## 📋 Emoji test

### Sample set

This page places emojis in headings to test bookmarks/TOC and PDF strings.

#### 🧪 Heading with emoji

title: Template for multilingual neutral text
date: 2024-06-02
version: 1.1
doc_type: template
show_in_summary: false
---
<a id="md-templates-multilingual-neutral-text"></a>


# Template for multilingual neutral text

This template provides guidelines for creating content suitable for all language versions.

## Principles

Multilingual neutral content:

- **Cultural neutrality**: Avoid culture-specific references, idioms, or examples
- **Universal concepts**: Use internationally recognised ideas and terminology
- **Technical focus**: Emphasise technical accuracy over cultural context
- **Symbol preference**: Use symbols, diagrams, and code over prose where possible

## Language considerations

### Avoid

❌ **Culture-specific examples:**

```markdown
Like preparing a traditional Sunday roast...
As American as apple pie...
```

❌ **Regional idioms:**

```markdown
It's raining cats and dogs
The proof is in the pudding
```

❌ **Country-specific references:**

```markdown
As required by UK GDPR...
Similar to the US ZIP code system...
```

### Prefer

✅ **Universal examples:**

```markdown
Like preparing a meal...
A widely recognised pattern...
```

✅ **Clear, literal language:**

```markdown
Heavy rainfall
Evidence demonstrates that...
```

✅ **International standards:**

```markdown
As required by ISO 8601...
Following RFC 3339 date format...
```

## Content patterns

### Technical documentation

Technical content is naturally more neutral:

```markdown
## Installation

1. Download the package
2. Extract to a directory
3. Run the installer
4. Verify installation with `command --version`
```

### Code examples

Code transcends language barriers:

```python
# Universal technical concepts
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)
```

### Mathematical notation

Mathematics is international:

```markdown
The Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
```

### Visual elements

Diagrams and symbols work across languages:

- Flowcharts
- Sequence diagrams
- Icons and symbols (Unicode)
- Tables and matrices

## Metadata structure

For multilingual documents:

```yaml
---
title: Your Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y
doc_type: chapter  # or appropriate type
language_neutral: true  # Flag for neutral content
translation_notes: "Focus on technical accuracy"
---
```

## Testing checklist

Before publishing multilingual content:

- [ ] No culture-specific references
- [ ] No idioms or colloquialisms
- [ ] Technical terms properly defined
- [ ] Code examples are universal
- [ ] Numbers and dates use ISO formats
- [ ] Currency symbols avoided (use generic "units")
- [ ] Time zones specified if relevant
- [ ] Measurements use metric (SI) units

## Translation workflow

When translating neutral content:

1. **Preserve structure**: Keep headings and formatting identical
2. **Technical accuracy**: Verify technical terms in target language
3. **Literal translation**: Avoid creative interpretation
4. **Code unchanged**: Never translate code variable names or commands
5. **Metadata sync**: Keep version and date metadata consistent

## Table design principles

### Readability

Tables are designed for:

- **Quick scanning**: Clear headers and consistent alignment
- **Data comparison**: Parallel structure for easy comparison
- **Reference use**: Complete information without requiring external context

### Consistency

All tables follow:

- Consistent column ordering
- Uniform header formatting
- Standard alignment rules (left for text, right for numbers)
- Descriptive captions

## Table types

### Comparative tables

Structure for comparing options:

| Feature | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | High | Medium | Low |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Cost | Low | Medium | High |

### Reference tables

Data lookup format:

| Key | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Term 1 | Definition | Detailed explanation |
| Term 2 | Definition | Detailed explanation |

### Multi-level tables

Hierarchical information:

| Category | Subcategory | Details |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Type A | Variant 1 | Specifications |
| | Variant 2 | Specifications |
| Type B | Variant 1 | Specifications |

## Data sources

### Primary sources

Tables are compiled from:

- Official documentation and specifications
- Published standards (ISO, RFC, etc.)
- Peer-reviewed research where applicable
- Vendor documentation and release notes

### Data verification

All tabulated data:

1. Cross-referenced with primary sources
2. Verified for current accuracy
3. Dated to indicate currency
4. Linked to source documentation where possible

### Update policy

Tables are reviewed:

- During major version updates
- When underlying specifications change
- Following significant technology releases
- As corrections are identified

## Formatting conventions

### Numerical data

- **Integers**: No decimal separator (1000, not 1,000)
- **Decimals**: Period as decimal separator (3.14)
- **Percentages**: Number followed by % symbol (85%)
- **Ranges**: En dash between values (10–20)

### Text alignment

- **Left-aligned**: Text, descriptions, category names
- **Right-aligned**: Numbers, dates, versions
- **Centre-aligned**: Yes/No, checkmarks, symbols

### Special symbols

- ✓ = Supported/Yes
- ✗ = Not supported/No
- — = Not applicable
- ≈ = Approximately
- ≥/≤ = Greater/less than or equal

## Caption format

Table captions include:

```markdown
Table X.Y: Descriptive title
```

Where:

- X = Chapter number
- Y = Sequential table number within chapter
- Title describes content succinctly

## Accessibility

### Screen readers

Tables use:

- Proper Markdown table syntax for correct HTML rendering
- Descriptive headers that work when read sequentially
- Captions that provide context independent of surrounding text

### Print readability

Table design considers:

- Page width constraints in PDF output
- Readability at standard print sizes

## Testing methodology

### Visual verification

All emoji and scripts:

1. Rendered in PDF output
2. Visually inspected for correctness
3. Checked for proper colour rendering (emoji)
4. Verified in both screen and print modes

### Font fallback chain

The system tests fallback behaviour:

```
Primary → Secondary → System fallback
```

- If primary font lacks a glyph, system tries secondary
- Final fallback to system fonts if needed
- Missing glyphs indicated by □ (replacement character)

### Known limitations

1. **ZWJ sequences**: Complex emoji may render as separate glyphs on older systems
2. **COLRv1 support**: Requires modern font rendering (Cairo 1.18+, FreeType 2.13+)
3. **RTL layout**: Simplified handling; complex bidirectional text may need adjustment
4. **Rare scripts**: Some scripts require additional font installation

## Font configuration

See [`fonts-storage/fonts.conf`](../../fonts-storage/fonts.conf) for the complete fontconfig configuration.

Key settings:

- Emoji font priority ordering
- Script-specific font mappings
- Fallback chains
- Hinting and antialiasing preferences- YAML frontmatter (document metadata)
- Heading hierarchy (TOC / PDF bookmarks)
- Lists, code blocks, blockquotes
- Tables and references
- Stable navigation (SUMMARY.md)

### Example table

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Heading | TOC/bookmarks |
| Table | list of tables |

### Example code block

```
python -m gitbook_worker.tools.workflow_orchestrator --help
```
