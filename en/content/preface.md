# Preface

This preface explains the purpose and structure of the sample book. All content is deliberately phrased in a neutral way so it can be used for usability tests, layout demos and localisation workflows.

- **Audience:** teams who want to test text, image or table components without using real customer data.
- **Structure:** each section contains at least one element commonly found in book production – for example figures, cross-references, citations or tables.
- **International scope:** the included template for multilingual text covers common major languages and can be extended.

Further guidance can be found in [Chapter 1](./chapters/chapter-01.md), while [Chapter 2](./chapters/chapter-02.md) provides concrete table layouts.
