# Index

Alphabetical subject index for quick access to topics.

## Purpose

The index enables:

- **Quick lookup**: Immediate access to specific terms

## Structure

The index is organised:

- **Alphabetically**: Sorted by initial letter
- **Hierarchically**: Main and sub-terms
- **With page references**: Direct links to sections
- **Cross-referenced**: "See also" notes

## Usage

### In printed versions

The index appears:

- At the end of the document
- After appendices and lists
- With page numbers for each reference

### In digital versions

## Indexing

### Entries

Typical index entries:

```

  Sub-term, Page
  Sub-term, Page

```

### Conventions

## Automatic generation

This index can be automatically generated from:

- Explicit index markers in Markdown
- Headings and subsections
- Glossary entries
- Code example titles

## Best practices

For effective indexing:

1. **Consistent terms**: Use uniform terminology
2. **Multiple entries**: Index concepts under different search terms
3. **Cross-references**: Connect related terms
4. **Avoid over-indexing**: Include only significant references

## Maintenance

The index should be:

- Updated with each major version
- Include new terms from added chapters
- Remove obsolete references
- Check consistency with glossary

_Note: A complete index is generated during the final build process and includes all indexed terms with precise page references._
