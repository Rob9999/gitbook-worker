# Chapter 1 – Observable patterns

This chapter introduces a neutral description of structured observations. All examples are based on generic measurement points that can be easily transferred to new contexts.

## 1.1 Method steps
1. **Define the frame:** determine the purpose of the observation (e.g. temperature, usage behaviour or process duration).
2. **Choose measurement points:** define neutral parameters that do not contain personal data.
3. **Secure documentation:** record measurement results in tables and cite the source, e.g. public data catalogues.[^1]

## 1.2 Example description
- *Measurement area:* a fictitious test area with a moderate climate.
- *Instruments:* standardised sensors with a calibration certificate.
- *Evaluation:* averages over a four-week period.

The resulting data is presented later in the book – in particular in [Chapter 2](./chapter-02.md) – in table form. Detailed data is also provided in [Appendix A](../appendices/appendix-a.md).
