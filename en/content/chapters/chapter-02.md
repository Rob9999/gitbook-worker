# Chapter 2 – Comparative tables

Tables are an indispensable tool for the structured presentation of information. They enable direct comparison of different options, technologies, or concepts at a glance.

## Fundamentals of tabular presentation

A well-designed table follows clear principles:

### Structure and organisation

| Element | Description | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Header row | Contains column labels | Orientation for the reader |
| Data rows | Contain the actual information | Comparable presentation |
| Summary | Optional: sums or averages | Aggregated insights |

### Design principles

Effective tables are characterised by the following features:

1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous column and row labels
2. **Consistency**: Uniform formatting within columns
3. **Readability**: Appropriate line spacing and font sizes
4. **Relevance**: Display only necessary information

## Comparison of programming paradigms

A practical example of using comparison tables is the juxtaposition of different programming paradigms:

| Paradigm | Main features | Typical languages | Application areas |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Imperative | Step-by-step instructions | C, Pascal, BASIC | Systems programming |
| Object-oriented | Classes and objects | Java, C++, Python | Enterprise applications |
| Functional | Immutable data | Haskell, Erlang, F# | Data processing |
| Declarative | What instead of How | SQL, HTML, Prolog | Database queries |

### Detailed consideration

Each paradigm has its strengths and weaknesses:

**Imperative programming**
- Direct control over flow
- Efficient at hardware level
- Can become confusing with complexity

**Object-oriented programming**
- Modular structure
- Reusability through inheritance
- Can lead to overhead

**Functional programming**
- No side effects
- Easy to test
- Learning curve for switchers

## Technology comparisons

Comparison tables are particularly suitable for technology decisions:

### Web framework comparison

| Framework | Language | Performance | Learning curve | Community |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Django | Python | Medium | Medium | Very large |
| Flask | Python | High | Low | Large |
| Spring | Java | Medium | High | Very large |
| Express | JavaScript | High | Low | Very large |
| Rails | Ruby | Medium | Medium | Large |

### Evaluation criteria

Various factors play a role in technology selection:

1. **Performance**: Throughput and response times
2. **Developer productivity**: Speed of development
3. **Maintainability**: Long-term maintenance effort
4. **Scalability**: Growth potential
5. **Ecosystem**: Available libraries and tools

## Database comparison

Another common application area is database comparisons:

| Type | Example | Consistency | Scaling | Use case |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Relational | PostgreSQL | ACID | Vertical | Transactions |
| Document | MongoDB | Eventual | Horizontal | Flexible schemas |
| Key-value | Redis | Eventual | Horizontal | Caching |
| Graph | Neo4j | ACID | Vertical | Relationships |
| Column | Cassandra | Eventual | Horizontal | Time series |

### CAP theorem

For distributed databases, the CAP theorem is relevant:

- **C**onsistency: All nodes see the same data
- **A**vailability: System always responds
- **P**artition tolerance: System functions despite network failures

According to the CAP theorem, only two of the three properties can be guaranteed simultaneously.

## Best practices for tables

When creating comparison tables, the following points should be considered:

### Content aspects

- Select relevant comparison criteria
- Use objective and verifiable data
- Cite sources where necessary
- Ensure data is current

### Visual design

- Zebra pattern for better readability in long tables
- Highlighting of important rows or columns
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Sorting and filtering options for interactive tables

## Summary

Comparison tables are a powerful tool for the structured presentation of complex information. They enable quick comparisons and informed decisions. The key to success lies in carefully selecting relevant criteria and presenting them clearly and consistently.
